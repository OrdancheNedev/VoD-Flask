# Introduction

This is a Video-on-demand web app. I developed it as a student project in order to show how you can build a web app for VoD, using Python Flask and Bootstrap.
All videos and images that i have used are from pixabay.com. In the pixabay.txt you can view the creators of the videos and images. 
The videos and images are dynamically genereted from data.txt, which serves as a JSON file, that connects the app to the Google Drive where the images and videos are stored.

The web app, has been succesfully tested on the following browsers: Google Chrome, Opera and Edge.
